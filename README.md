# REST API for an E-Commerce Application

* This project is developed by a team of 5 members during our project week in Masai School, Bengaluru. 
* We have developed a REST API for an e-commerce platform. This API performs the fundamental operations of any e-commerce platform with user validation at every step.

## Tech Stack

* Java
* Spring Framework
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Hibernate
* MySQL (to persist data in database)

## Features

* Customers can register themselves and buy products, seller can perform the administrator functions of adding or deleting products. We have written business logic to authenticate and validate users at every point so that unknown users do not update the persisted data in our database.
